# Unique Identification Enrollment & Demographic Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a large-scale **citizen identity enrollment dataset** collected as part of a national unique identification registration program (conceptually similar to Aadhaar enrollment). The goal is to extract meaningful insights from demographic and enrollment data to understand coverage, trends, and operational efficiency across regions.

This project is structured as a **government-style data analytics case study**, suitable for academic submissions, internships, and entry-level data analyst portfolios.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze citizen enrollment trends across regions
- Study demographic distribution such as age group and gender
- Identify high- and low-enrollment regions
- Evaluate enrollment performance and data completeness
- Generate insights to support data-driven public policy planning

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized citizen enrollment records from a national identity registration system.

**Key attributes include:**
- Enrollment ID / Center ID
- State / District / Region
- Gender
- Age / Age Group
- Date of Enrollment
- Enrollment Status
- Demographic and biometric capture indicators

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.
